# SynSig_Updated: Synaptic Signatures

The synapse is a complex protein-dense structure critical for proper brain functioning. The molecular composition of the synaptic network is incompletely defined, impeding our understanding of healthy and diseased neurological functions. To address this gap, we devised a machine learning system to capture core features of the synapse from their genomic, transcriptomic, and structural patterns – a “synaptic signature” – leading to the identification of novel synaptic proteins.
